//I need to create an object 
spawnObjects(x, y, color, width, height,type)
    Math.floor(Math.random() * game.width) = x
    Math.floor(Math.random() * game.height)= y
    this.color = color
    this.width = width
    this.height = height
    this.type = true
//That object will have an x, y, color, width, height 
//I would 4 of each on the bad objects and 2 of each on the good objects
// let objLocation = []
// const createLocation = () => {
//     for(i= 0; i < 5; i++) {

//     }
// }
// I would like this objects to appear randomly on the board when the game starts
