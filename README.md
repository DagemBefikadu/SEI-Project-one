Hoop Dreams

Idea: 

Hoop Dreams gives users the chance to step on a basketball court and experience that amazing feeling basketball players get. They even get to touch the same basketballs that the players use. Unfortunately, the court can get messy with fans spilling their food, and puddles of sweat appearing on the court! HOOP DREAMERS to the rescue!!!

Hoop Dreamers will go around the court and collect all the game balls before the clock runs out. While avoiding the food and sweat puddles. Grabbing the dirty balls get them extra points (helps protect players from getting sick). The court needs to be cleared before the players return to Start the Game! Are you up for the challengeâ€¦

Display Instructions and Start Game Button

Game Starts: Display Title, Clock and Point Counter

Display Hoop Dreamer

Display Good Basketball, Dirty Basketball, Food and Sweat Puddles 

Start clock after the first AWSD movement is detected 

As the Hoop Dreamer walks around and collects objects, adjust the pointer for good and bad objects. 

If the clock runs out and the player has less then 10 points they lose or if the other player collects more objects 

Stretch GOALS:

Maybe display more bad points in the last ten second

Have the bad points appear and disappear throughout the game randomly. 

Create different levels of the game where less good points appear on the game board. 

Make the background screen of the game board the users favorite team logo.

Create the "Swoosh" sound for when a ball is collected and a whistle sound for food or sweat puddles.
