Hoop Dreams

Idea: 

Hoop Dreams gives users the chance to step on the court, get that amazing feeling basketball players get. They even get to touch the same basketballs that the players get to use. Unfortantely the court can get messy with fans spilling there food, and puddles of sweat appearing on the court that need to be cleaned. 

Thats where the Hoop Dreamer comes in, they will go around the court and collect all the game balls before the clock runs out. While avoiding the food and  sweat puddles. Grabbing the dirty balls get you extra points (avoid the players from getting sick)
